# 🌐 TrustSeal: AI-Powered Document Authenticity Verification  

## ✨ Inspiration  
In today’s world, digital transactions are everywhere—**contracts, academic certificates, identity documents, and financial records** are exchanged daily. Unfortunately, so are **frauds and manipulations**.  
With the rise of **deepfakes** and advanced editing tools, even trained experts can struggle to detect **tampered or counterfeit documents**.  

Our team asked:  
> *How can we restore trust in digital documents while keeping verification fast and user-friendly?*  

This question inspired **TrustSeal**: an AI-powered verification system that instantly analyzes documents for tampering, forgery, and hidden anomalies.

## 🛠️ What It Does  
TrustSeal provides users with:  

- 📤 **Upload & Verify**: Supports PDFs, images, and Word files.  
- 🔎 **Tampering Detection**: AI detects pixel-level edits, cloning, and inconsistencies.  
- 📑 **Metadata Analysis**: Checks timestamps, origin, and hidden properties.  
- 🔤 **OCR & NLP**: Extracts text for semantic consistency and anomaly detection.  
- 📊 **Confidence Score**: Shows probability of authenticity vs fraud.  
- 🖼️ **Heatmap Visualization**: Highlights suspicious regions in the document.  
- 📜 **Detailed Reports**: Exportable for compliance or auditing purposes.  

---

## ⚙️ How We Built It  
We designed TrustSeal as a **modular verification pipeline** with several layers:  

1. **Document Preprocessing** – Normalization, resizing, and cleaning for OCR.  
2. **OCR & NLP** – Using Tesseract + Transformers to extract text, then validate language patterns.  
3. **Image Forensics** – Detecting pixel anomalies, compression irregularities, and copy-move edits.  
4. **Metadata Checks** – Comparing embedded timestamps, authorship, and revision history.  
5. **Confidence Scoring** – A formula combining all anomaly signals:  

Inline: \( Score = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i f_i}{n} \)  

Display:  

$$
Score = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i f_i}{n}
$$  

where \( f_i \) are anomaly features and \( w_i \) are their respective weights.  

6. **User Dashboard** – React-based frontend with a clean, modern UI.  
7. **Database Layer** – TiDB Serverless for structured + vector data storage.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced  
- **OCR Complexity**: Dealing with scanned documents that had stamps, watermarks, and handwritten notes.  
- **False Positives**: Differentiating real tampering from natural compression artifacts.  
- **Scalability**: Ensuring large file analysis didn’t slow down queries.  
- **Time Pressure**: Building a working prototype in just a few days.  

---

## 📚 What We Learned  
- How combining **OCR, image forensics, and metadata analysis** produces stronger fraud detection.  
- Practical use of **vector databases** (TiDB) for anomaly search.  
- The importance of **explainable AI**: Users trust results more when they can *see* anomalies via heatmaps.  
- Effective **team collaboration** and rapid prototyping in a hackathon environment.  

---

## 💡 Future Plans  
We see TrustSeal becoming more than just a hackathon project:  

- ✅ Blockchain-inspired immutable audit trail for verified documents.  
- ✅ Integration with **universities, banks, and government systems**.  
- ✅ Support for **real-time API** for enterprise verification.  
- ✅ Multi-language OCR support for global adoption.
